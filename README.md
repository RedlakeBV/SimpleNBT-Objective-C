What is SimpleNBT?
------------------
Modified NBT for the Spout project. Based on Graham Edgecombe's JNBT library. NBT (Named Binary Tag) is a tag based binary format designed to carry large amounts of binary data with smaller amounts of additional data.



Thanks to [Flow][Github] for suppling the Java version.
I made this port to Objective-C because there was none available and I decided to share this with the rest of the world.
